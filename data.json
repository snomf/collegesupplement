    "college_description": "Go from dream to do.\n\nThe California Institute of Technology, or Caltech for short, is a world-renowned hub for science and engineering brilliance! Caltech marshals some of the world's brightest minds and most innovative tools to address fundamental scientific questions and pressing societal challenges. Caltech’s extraordinary faculty and students are all about pushing boundaries and making breakthroughs. They’re out there, exploring the universe and inventing the technologies of the future, with research interests from quantum science and engineering to bioinformatics and the nature of life itself, from human behavior and economics to energy and sustainability.\n\nYour journey begins with Caltech’s core curriculum where you’ll receive an interdisciplinary education that teaches both the technical and communication skills that you will need in any field you pursue. Because science crosses boundaries and multiple perspectives are key to success, every Techer (Caltech lingo for students), no matter their discipline, gets to explore various classes in the basic sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Caltech's math classes will test your resolve. Brace yourself for problem sets (aka homework) that will challenge you like never before! These problem sets will push your limits and build both your academic and personal resilience. You'll emerge as a stronger, more confident problem solver! \n\nCaltech's humanities and social science classes will challenge you to think critically and communicate clearly. They will give you a broader understanding of society and the world. Also, they will open incredible opportunities at the intersection of fields. From brain science to climate change, many of today’s research frontiers cross disciplines. Students declare an academic option, or major, at the end of their first-year.\n\nWhen you come to Caltech, you are treated as a scientist from day one. With over 50 research centers and institutes on campus, including 5 NASA facilities, Techers spend a lot of time in the lab. In fact, Caltech students conduct research with Nobel Prize winners. Research is an integral part of who they are and what they do – and that includes you. Over 90% of undergraduate students do research, and about half get involved in their first year. The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program introduces students to research under the guidance of seasoned research mentors at Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nBut hold on, it's not all lab coats and test tubes! While Techers excel in STEM, they exhibit a diverse range of interests beyond the classroom. Caltech students are not just scientists, they are athletes, actors, musicians, artists, and more. With over 100 official student-led clubs and organizations, you’ll have endless opportunities to explore and connect with like-minded souls. If you don't find something that interests you, you can start your own club. \n\nCaltech students understand that science itself is an art form, and they have a strong appreciation of the fine arts. Their Performing & Visual Arts department engages students in a deeper appreciation of music, theater, and visual arts. Caltech students can take classes and get involved with performances to connect with their creativity outside of the lab. If you’re looking to find community and explore your own identity, the Caltech Center for Inclusion & Diversity (CCID) is a safe space to connect with others who share your identities and to learn about ways you can advocate for yourself and those around you.",

Students solve complex problems, explore their passions, and find every opportunity to get involved.\n\nAs a Jesuit, Catholic liberal arts college, Holy Cross knows that the best way to understand the world is to embrace the full spectrum of perspectives and life experiences. Students are challenged to not only experience more during their college years, but also start their journey to self-discovery. Through volunteer work, lively academic discourse, and an active social scene, students make and are supported by lifelong friends, growing side by side.\n\nThe academic programs at Holy Cross are rigorous, and students have every opportunity to explore their interests and dive deep into their chosen academic path. Each first-year student enters Holy Cross undeclared and chooses a major, with the help of their faculty adviser, by the end of their sophomore year. Holy Cross also provides students the chance to design their own major or minor in a field of study that lies outside the current discipline-based majors or interdisciplinary concentrations. Each Holy Cross student’s curriculum consists of common requirements (which can be fulfilled by selecting from a wide range of courses), a major, and freely elected courses.\n\nSome of the country’s most dedicated professors find a home at Holy Cross — an institution where they can explore new intellectual terrain and bring their students along for the journey. Professors serve as inspiring mentors, transforming lives in and out of the classroom through their expertise, wisdom, and humanity. The J.D. Power Center is the central hub for experiential learning at Holy Cross, offering opportunities for internships, community-based learning courses, and research projects.\n\nWhen Holy Cross students graduate, they are prepared to think critically, synthesize knowledge across disciplines, communicate effectively, and act with respect to cultural and global contexts. Across nearly every industry, Holy Cross alumni tackle complex challenges and serve as leaders of their field. The most popular industries for these alumni included health care; financial services; technology; government, politics and law; and education. 89% of respondents from the class of 2024 report being employed in a job or internship, in graduate school, engaged in service work, or on a fellowship.",

The First Year Program (FYP) is designed to help incoming students enjoy and adjust to their first year at Colorado College and the Block Plan. Student life is vibrant. With 100+ student clubs/organizations, 90% of students participating in athletics (either at the varsity or club/intramural level), 200+ Outdoor Education trips each year, and 80% of the student body participating in volunteer opportunities, CC students have a great balance of academics and extracurricular involvement in the heart of the Rocky Mountain west.",

A flexible curriculum with a liberal arts framework, unparalleled access to research, and exposure to diverse perspectives, encourages students to think about how they learn and make connections between subjects when exploring their interests. 98% of Hopkins students put their learning into practice through hands-on experiences, like research and internships.  \n\nChampioning Your Success\n\nThe Center for Student Success helps first-generation and limited-income students thrive through coaching, mentoring, collaborations with campus partners, and community-building programs. A network of advisors, faculty mentors, and peer groups helps cultivate a supportive community, so students can design the college experience that’s right for them.\n\nBlue Jay Spirit\n\nAs leaders, creators, and innovators, Hopkins students are engaged members of the community. Students are a vital part of enduring university traditions like Blue Jay Opening Day, Lighting of the Quads, and Spring Fair that bring the entire Hopkins campus together to celebrate the community. With over 400 student-run organizations, Hopkins creates abundant opportunities for students to network with peers, faculty, and staff, while connecting students to resources to help them navigate and take advantage of experiential learning opportunities. Hopkins becomes more than a university for its students; it’s a place they call home for four years.",

These include programs in language immersion, literature and literacy, and the oldest and most prestigious writers’ conference in the world. At Middlebury, they want students to graduate world ready and work ready, having the life skills, perspectives, and supportive networks to pursue the future they imagine for themselves.",

    "college_description": "From its founding in 1833, Oberlin College has been at the forefront of history. In 1835, Oberlin became the first college in the United States to adopt a policy to admit students of color. In 1841, Oberlin became the first to award degrees to women in a coeducational program. By 1900, Oberlin had produced one-third of all African American college graduates in the United States.\n\nAt Oberlin, you’ll find that you truly have the power to make a difference. An emphasis on risk-taking and innovation pervades the college and the conservatory, inside and outside the classroom. Oberlin's 2,900 students are engaged, determined, intellectual, and creative and embrace the idea that one person can change the world. \n\nOberlin has been a longtime leader in educating undergraduate scientists, and since 1920, more Oberlin graduates have earned PhDs than the graduates of any other primarily baccalaureate college in America. Students interested in engineering can participate in a five-year 3/2 Engineering program, which allows students to earn a Bachelor of Arts from Oberlin and a Bachelor of Science from one of four schools: Case Western Reserve, Caltech, Columbia, and Washington University in St. Louis. With advising through a Premed program, Oberlin science majors are accepted into medical school at a rate twice the national average. \n\nOberlin’s learning environment is like no other, combining a top-ranked liberal arts college, a prestigious music conservatory, and one of the finest academic art museums in the country – on a single campus. The College of Arts and Sciences and the Conservatory of Music share one campus. Students can apply to the unique Double Degree program, to receive both a Bachelor of Arts from the College of Arts and Sciences and a Bachelor of Music from the Conservatory of Music, or major in music as an Arts and Sciences Student, by immersing yourself in five Interdivisional programs. \n\nLearning happens both inside and outside of the classroom at Oberlin. Through the four-week Winter Term in January, students devise and pursue on and off-campus programs of independent study or research, and undertake – individually or with a group – projects outside the structured curriculum. Oberlin’s Career Community Program encourages all third-year and fourth year students to participate in a guaranteed paid-internship in order to gain skills and experience relevant to their career interests, along with Winter Term credit and an experiential opportunity. Oberlin’s Creativity and Leadership Project and its LaunchU program provides students the opportunity to participate in workshops and receive mentorship that will help develop skills essential to planning and launching a business venture.\n\nOn average, 80% of students study abroad at some point during their Oberlin experience, which has led the college to be ranked fifth in the top 25 baccalaureate institutions in the nation for total number of study-abroad students. Oberlin hosts an extraordinary lineup of speakers and performers throughout the year, and students produce hundreds of their own recitals, theater and dance performances, art exhibitions, and more. Learn about more experiential learning by major here: Research, Internships, Study Away and Experiential Learning by Major.\n\nOberlin College would like to make the following acknowledgement: Although they mark the founding of their town and college in 1833, the history of the land that Oberlin occupies extends much further than that. Oberlin was founded on the traditional homelands of the Erie, Wyandotte, Mingo and other Indigenous Nations. The only way they can in good conscience celebrate Oberlin’s values is to first acknowledge the indigenous peoples whose stories and role in their land’s history have long been ignored. While this single gesture is not enough, they use this as a step towards bringing visibility and increasing engagement with all of the histories and communities that have led them to the Oberlin community that is cherished today.",

Whether you want to explore an internship in the entertainment industry or in medical research, you will have easy access to opportunities. Through Pomona’s PCIP program, students can also secure funding for summer internships anywhere in the U.S. or abroad. About half of Pomona's students study abroad, choosing among 63 programs in 36 countries. \n\nSo even though Pomona’s small classes, strength across the curriculum, and tight-knit residential life (4 years guaranteed housing) might seem common, Pomona College is unique. Founded in 1887, in a state whose motto is “Eureka!”, Pomona College prides itself on being an incubator for ideas. The combination of a rigorous and interdisciplinary academic curriculum, faculty who challenge and support students in equal measure, and a talented and diverse student community leads to amazing outcomes for Pomona alumni.\n\nPomona’s role as the founding member of the Claremont College Consortium expands opportunity for Sagehens. The five colleges are located within a square mile, so it’s easy to walk to a class, club meeting, or dining hall on a neighboring campus. Resource centers open to all students like the QRC (Queer Resource Center), OBSA (Office of Black Student Affairs), CLSA (Chicano/Latino Student Affairs), NIRC (Native Indigenous Resource Center), and the McAlister Center for Religious Activities serve all the Claremont Colleges, ensuring vibrant mentor programs and resources for the diverse student body.

At Princeton, you choose one major from 37 academic areas in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. First-year students take Freshman Seminars as an introduction to academic writing and intellectual inquiry. Independent work is a hallmark of the Princeton undergraduate experience, and junior and senior independent academic research culminates in a senior thesis.\n\nThe majority of students live on campus, which is well-regarded for its architectural beauty. Students are welcomed into one of seven residential colleges offering a variety of academic and social programs, as well as academic advising. These colleges are designed to help you transition to campus and establish a strong sense of community. At Princeton, you are encouraged to expand your horizons, whether it is exploring the 500+ student organizations on campus, participating in service opportunities that focus on global concerns, or studying and interning abroad in one of 44 countries.\n\nEstablished in 2021 through a gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Emma Bloomberg Center for Access and Opportunity enhances and expands Princeton University’s fundamental commitment to the college success of talented First-Generation Low-income (FLI) students.

New and unique areas of study include African Studies, Architecture, Business, Medical Humanities, Music, and Sport Management. With the goal of giving undergraduates a broad education beyond their major, Rice has established flexible distribution requirements as part of the requirements for graduation. By the time they graduate, students will have taken three classes in each of the humanities, social sciences, and applied sciences. Rice builds flexibility into the requirements so that students have the freedom to select the courses that interest them most. \n\nExperiential learning is an important part of education at Rice. Starting as early as freshman year, no matter their major, Rice students have the opportunity to conduct research alongside experts. With 45+ research centers, 150 study abroad programs in over 50 countries, and access to a variety of internship-focused resources, students have no shortage of opportunities to explore their interests and develop their passions.\n\nAt the core of the Rice undergraduate experience is the residential college system, where students connect with each other and support each other throughout their time at Rice. Students are assigned to one of 11 residential colleges, each with their own unique culture and traditions. One of the longest standing campus traditions, the Honor Code at Rice fosters a spirit of freedom, independence, honesty, and mutual trust.

Beyond the residential college system, students can join more than 300 clubs in anything that interests them, from cultural groups to volunteer organizations.\n\nAs the nation’s fourth largest and most culturally diverse city, Houston delivers rich opportunities for Rice students. Every undergraduate student at Rice is given a Passport to Houston, which provides free, unlimited use of the public transportation system and access to many entertainment and cultural venues in Houston. Whether looking to try a new cuisine or spend an afternoon at the museum, students love to venture beyond the hedges to experience all that Houston has to offer.",

Swatties collaborate, rather than compete; they like to dive deep and then put their ideas to work. The idyllic, 425-acre arboretum campus features rolling lawns, a creek, wooded hills, and hiking trails. Swarthmore is located just 11 miles from Philadelphia, PA, with a train station at the foot of campus.\n\nStudents choose from more than 600 different courses with over 50 programs of study, ranging from economics and computer science to philosophy and an ABET-accredited engineering program. In addition, students may cross-register for classes at Bryn Mawr College, Haverford College, and the University of Pennsylvania. Celebrating over 100 years, Swarthmore’s self-selected Honors Program, is distinctive: it features small seminar classes that explore specific topics with remarkable collaboration between students and faculty, and culminates in examinations conducted by external experts in their fields.\n\nFirst-year students do not receive letter grades on their transcripts for their fall semester courses. Instead, their professors provide them with meaningful feedback on their work, and students receive “credit” or “no credit” marks on their transcript (Swarthmore's version of pass/fail). Class ranks and GPAs are not published. This allows students to take intellectual risks, adjust to college-level coursework, collaborate with peers, and focus on learning for learning’s sake. An emphasis is placed on independent research and special projects. Students frequently enter into dialogue with peers, teachers, and external experts.\n\nSwarthmore offers a wide range of resources for budding entrepreneurs and students who are passionate about public service. The Center for Innovation and Leadership provides tools for students to develop and implement their ideas while building entrepreneurship and leadership skills. Swarthmore’s Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility supports students who engage in impactful community-based work beyond their academic pursuits. Swarthmore also has extensive pre-professional advising available for students interested in the health sciences and legal professions.\n\nIncoming students join a vibrant and collaborative campus community that challenges assumptions and increases shared understanding.

    "college_description": "Located five miles from downtown Boston, Tufts is a medium-sized research and liberal arts university with a focus on student-faculty relationships, a culture of collaboration and innovation, and cultivating global citizens. Tufts' 6,900 undergraduate students pursue majors in one of three schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering, or the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA at Tufts). As an R1 institution, students delve into world-class research easily and early, exploring fields from infectious diseases and water treatment to music cognition, from biomaterials that detect toxins to the impact of political discourse online. In the School of Engineering, faculty and students explore the ethical development of robotic technology and developing systems to repair or replace damaged organs and tissues. Meanwhile, SMFA students develop their individual artistic visions to engage creative areas like photography, sculpture, or the intersection of installation, virtual reality, and painting. 96% of recent Tufts graduates were employed, in graduate school, or participating in a fellowship within six months of graduation, and undergraduates may also pursue fifth-year graduate programs and early admission pathways with Tufts' professional schools.\n\nIn Tufts’ Experimental College, students enroll in or teach small seminars that engage with ideas shaping the world, including issues in politics, technology, law, health care, media, and more. Courses are taught by current undergraduate students and by visiting lecturers who are active professionals across industries (think courses like “Financial Innovation through Technology: New Ways of Building the Future” and “Exploring Biodiversity in Human-Altered Environments”). You can’t fit Tufts students into a box. They are intellectually powerful, down-to-earth, driven, and civic-minded. At Tufts, they learn how to make a measurable difference and then start making it—even as undergraduates. Tufts is home to the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life, a national leader in civic education and research. Through an intensive leadership program, summer internship experiences, semester-long international service-learning programs, and other initiatives, Tisch College seeks to prepare students for a lifetime of engagement in civic and democratic life.\n\nStudents find community through an array of dedicated gathering spaces and programs open to all undergraduate and graduate students at Tufts, including the Africana Center, Asian American Center, Granoff Family Hillel Center, Indigenous Center, Latinx Center, LGBT Center, University Chaplaincy, and Women’s Center. The FIRST Resource Center serves as a home for students who identify with the first-generation college experience, offering mentorship programs, first-year seminars, and an optional pre-orientation. The Center for STEM Diversity at Tufts fosters success in STEM fields for students from all backgrounds through a summer bridge program, first-year seminar, and supported research opportunities. Students also find community and belonging through the QuestBridge Scholars Network, 28 varsity athletic teams, 30+ club teams, and a variety of affinity groups, faith gatherings, pre-professional organizations, and performance ensembles.",

Wellesley students break barriers, build bridges, and shift paradigms. We know that the boldest ideas, the brightest solutions, and the healthiest communities draw on a range of voices, perspectives, and experiences. Wellesley continues to expand the understanding of what women can and will do.\n\nAll students come into Wellesley undecided; declaring a major in their sophomore year. Students can select from 1,000+ classes in over 56 departments, majors, and programs of study ranging from architecture to astronomy to Middle Eastern studies to neuroscience. First-year students enroll in writing seminars designed exclusively to help ease the transition from high school to college and to learn and discuss various subject areas in more depth. Our first-semester shadow grading policy (meaning all courses are graded pass/fail!) provides first-year students the space and support to transition to a residential college experience while actively exploring new intellectual opportunities.\n\nExperiential learning is deeply embedded in the Wellesley experience. Students choose to go abroad and to supplement their education in the classroom with internships and community service projects locally, nationally, and internationally. Over 90% of seniors complete at least one internship by the time they graduate. Literally hundreds of research opportunities are available to Wellesley students, often one-on-one with a professor. \n\nWellesley Plus, a voluntary transition program for first year students, and the First Generation/Low Income Network, are programs housed in our Office of Student Success designed to support and connect students that are the first in their families to attend college.\n\nOutside of academia, Wellesley students have perhaps too many (if there is such a thing!) student-run organizations as options to join…over 180 to be more exact. Our community also encourages students to lead and create new organizations. Every year, hundreds of events (on-campus concerts, trips into Boston and Cambridge, specialized lectures, and more!) are held to ensure students find community and joy throughout their time at Wellesley.\n\nDid you know that Flower Sunday is the oldest and longest-surviving Wellesley tradition? Held annually in September, Flower Sunday is a day of siblinghood and celebration, featuring song, music, and dance where all new first-year students (littles) are matched with upperclass students (bigs) in their residence halls. As you can imagine, floral outfits abound, and littles are gifted flowers (upon flowers) from their bigs.\n\nOur approach to education works: six months after commencement, 97% of the members of the Class of 2024 were embarking on careers in technology, media, art, education, business, or research or pursuing graduate study in law, medicine, or public health. The power of a Wellesley education is evident in the immediate and ongoing impact of our graduates. They are Rhodes Scholars, writers of celebrated TV shows, movies, and books, space shuttle commanders, environmental revolutionaries, civil rights activists, and investment trailblazers. They are Korea’s first female ambassador and two U.S. secretaries of state. They co-founded Zipcar, introduced Harry to Sally, and saved the Everglades.",

    "college_description": "Students come to Williams from around the world for reasons as different and varied as their backgrounds, but they start with a few things in common. They want to study with some of the world’s leading professors who are as eager to teach and mentor as they are to conduct research or create. They’re after the eclectic campus life and beautiful, natural surroundings of western Massachusetts. Remarkable freedom and resources are at their disposal so they may explore widely and deeply and grow as an individual and as a citizen of a global society. The Williams Tutorial, modeled after the Oxford Tutorial system, pairs two students with a faculty member in deep inquiry of a single topic over an entire semester. Many students further engage with Williams faculty over the summer, when they work on campus as fully paid research fellows in the humanities, natural and mathematical sciences, and social sciences. The vast majority Williams students conduct research with professors and the college provides (substantial research funding for students historically underrepresented in higher education.\n\nAt Williams, all first-years live together in a thoughtfully constructed microcosm of the Williams community known as an Entry. The vast majority of students are involved in at least one extracurricular activity, either by participating in service, playing for one of Williams’ Division III athletic teams, or showcasing their creative energy through music, dance, or theater groups.\n\nAll of this is done in a setting that's collaborative instead of cutthroat, nurturing the pursuit of excellence in an atmosphere of generosity.\n\nThe Williams Office of Fellowships advises and prepares students to compete for national fellowships and awards like Fulbright, Rhodes, and Watson fellowships. Employers in finance, consulting, the arts, technology, and others value the critical thinking and problem solving abilities cultivated in the Williams academic environment. The '68 Center for Career Exploration regularly places students in internships and full-time jobs via on-campus recruiting, Williams-specific job listings and networking events. Williams offers pre-professional advising for students interested in pursuing the health professions, law, engineering, and business.",
